          <p>We&#39;re so pleased you&#39;ve joined, and look forward to celebrating with you; here are a few ways you can help grow the movement: </p>
          <p><b>Tell your friends</b>: Encouraging friends to join is one of the most valuable things you can do - aside from the huge impact of their donations, celebrating is more fun when we do it together! Why not show them our website, share our posts on social media, and invite friends to follow our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/raiseoxford/">Facebook page</a> themselves?</p>
          <p><b>Social media</b>: One of the best ways to spread the word is through social media - you could share our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/raiseoxford/">Facebook page</a> or one of our posts.
          </p>
          <!--p><b>Committee</b>: If you really want to shape the future of Raise, you could apply to join our central
            committee, which coordinates everything we do - from events and partnerships to fundraising and publicity.
            Applications for next academic year will open in May, but we&#39;re always interested in hearing from people
            who want to get involved, register your interest using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OnHB86LDEeERtK0zes7B7qnXAsBGwQLu2-gwplDpsQc/viewform">this form</a> or you can email us at raiseoxford@gmail.com!</p>
          <p><b>College Reps</b>: Becoming an Raise rep is a low-commitment and flexible role for people who want to spread
            the message in their college, society or social group. We&#39;re always interested in hearing from people who want to get involved - email us at raiseoxford@gmail.com!</p-->
          <p><b>Sponsorship</b>: In order to put on our Summer Party at the end of each year, we rely entirely on the
            support of our generous partners. If you
            know anyone who may be interested in supporting Raise and allowing us to grow even more, please do <a
              href='/#contact'>get in touch</a>.</p>

          &pound;150 is a lot of money - what if I can't donate that?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;150 is a large amount of money for many students, and whilst we have thought carefully about recommending this amount
          (see next question), it is important to us that any student feels able to join us in celebrating through giving.</p>
          <p>As such, whilst we recommend &pound;150, you are welcome to join Raise by making a donation of a size which
            is <b>significant to you</b> and allows you to put charity at the heart of your end-of-year celebrations. It is
            central to our philosophy (see <a href='/#our-philosophy'>here</a> for more) that students actively engage
            with their decision to celebrate in Trinity through giving, but we recognise that the donation that enables
            this will not be the same for everyone.</p>
          <p>In addition, you have the option of donating in weekly installments,
            as some have found this more manageable. A weekly donation of &pound;9 from the donations launch up
            until the party adds up to about &pound;150, which will still be doubled through our matched funding.</p>
          <p>Note: We have ensured that our donations page allows you to hide your name and/or donation amount, should
            you choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend &pound;150?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;150 is a large amount of money, and substantially more than most students would
            routinely donate to charity. There are several reasons we recommend this figure:</p>
          <p><b>Ball Symbolism</b>: The &pound;150 figure is representative of the cost of many ball tickets -
            this is symbolic of our belief that charity can be embraced as an integral part of Trinity celebrations, on a par with
            balls.</p>
          <p><b>Encouraging considered giving</b>: We understand that donating &pound;150 is a significant commitment
            for any student, but this is key to <a href='/#our-philosophy'>our philosophy</a> of putting giving at the
            heart of Trinity celebrations. We aim to encourage students to think differently about charity, and we can
            only achieve this if students consciously engage in the act of giving, and donating a significant amount
            facilitates this. This is why we recommend &pound;150, or a donation of any size significant to the donor. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          I&#39;m already going to a ball. Is Raise really for me? (Hint: yes, definitely!)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Of course, Raise is for everyone - whether you&#39;re going to three balls or none, we welcome you to join
            our growing community and put charity at the heart of your celebrations. Raise is an alternative way
            to celebrate, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t take part in other things going on!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Can I donate to a different charity?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend (see below), particularly given how much
            money students are donating. However, we recognise that some students may want to join us in celebrating through giving,
            but would prefer to donate to a different charity. This is absolutely fine, but please
            get in touch with us beforehand so that we are aware.</p>
          <p>Note: All matched funding will still go to Against Malaria Foundation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend donating to AMF?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend. When students are making such significant
            donations, we want to make sure the money is doing as much good as it possibly can. To make our decision, we
            have taken the advice of independent charity evaluators <a
              href='https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities'>GiveWell</a> and <a
              href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org'>Giving What We Can</a>, which both rank AMF as one of the most
            effective charities in the world.</p>
          <p>Tragically, malaria causes 400,000 preventable deaths every year, disproportionately affecting young
            children and pregnant women, and has a knock-on effect on the local economy. AMF works with local partners
            to provide life-saving bed-nets which protect people as they sleep. To find out more about their work, see
            <a href='https://www.againstmalaria.com/'>here</a>.</p>
          <p>Because AMF's intervention is so effective at preventing malaria, each donation can have a huge impact. For
            example, a donation of &pound;150, doubled through matched funding, can help protect 350 people. 
            For example, the money raised by our sister organisation, MWA, in Cambridge in 2019
            was enough to protect over 40,000 people - more than double the student population of Cambridge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          If 100% of donations go to charity, how do you put on the Summer Party? What&#39;s it like?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Summer Party is a chance for us to celebrate our collective impact and say thank you to everyone who 
            has supported Raise throughout the year &mdash; everyone who has donated (whatever the amount) is invited. <strong> 
            will be music, food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and live entertainment</strong>, as well as the chance to 
            enjoy the collective atmosphere of celebration at the end of the year with the rest of the Raise community and 
            reflect on the impact our donations have made. Many of those who attended the Summer Party of our sister organisation
            in Cambridge last year said that the feel-good atmosphere was the highlight of their May Week!</p>

          <p>The exact format of the summer party this year will, of course, vary in line with government restrictions and we will keep the community updated on this through our social media channels.</p>

          <p><b>Crucially, 100% of the money students donate goes directly to charity &mdash; none of it is used to fund
              the party</b>. To make the Summer Party as enjoyable and meaningful as possible, we rely on the generous
            support, both financial and in-kind, of donors who buy into the Raise
            philosophy. Our venue will be donated for free, performers offer their time for free, and the food and
            drink will either be donated by local companies or paid for by sponsors. If you or anyone you know is able to
            support us through in-kind donations or sponsorship, please <a href='/#contact'>get in touch</a>.</p>

              We hope that through Raise, students will come to think differently about giving and will take this positive
              approach towards charity forward into their future lives.
