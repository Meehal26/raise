# Raise website

This repository contains the resources for the Raise website. It is hosted using [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html), and is visibile at [joinraise.org](https://joinraise.org).

Any changes you make here on the master branch will immediately be visible on the website. Please therefore make major changes via merge requests instead of editing master directly.

Additionally, all files in this repository are public so please be careful uploading any files even if they aren't referenced on the main pages.
