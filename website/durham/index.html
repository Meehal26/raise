          <p>Awesome! We'll be launching our donations period in early 2021, so come back then to donate here!</p>
          <p>In the meantime, why not <a href="/">become a Raise rep</a>?</p>

          <p>We're so pleased you're interested in Raise, and look forward to celebrating with you! Here are a few ways you can help grow the movement:</p>
          <p><b>Raise Reps:</b> Becoming a Raise rep is a low-commitment and flexible role for people who want to spread the message in their college, society or social group. We're recruiting now, so <a href="/">sign up</a> to get involved!</p>
          <p><b>Spread the word:</b> Letting your friends know about Raise is one of the most valuable things you can do - aside from the huge impact of their donations, celebrating is more fun when we do it together! Why not show them our website, share our posts on social media, and invite friends to follow our <a href="/">Facebook</a> and <a href="/">Instagram</a> pages themselves?</p>
          <p><b>Committee:</b> If you really want to shape the future of Raise, you could apply to join our committee, which coordinates everything we do, from events and partnerships to fundraising and publicity. Applications for the next academic year will open in the spring, but we're always interested in hearing from people who want to get involved!</p>
          <p><b>Sponsorship:</b> In order to put on our Summer Party at the end of each year, we rely entirely on the support of our generous partners, including the university, businesses and individuals. If you know anyone who may be interested in supporting Raise and allowing us to grow even more, please do <a href="/">get in touch</a>.</p>

          &pound;75 is a lot of money - what if I can't donate that?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;75 is a large amount of money for many students, and whilst we have thought carefully about recommending this amount (see next question), it is important to us that any student feels able to join us in celebrating through giving.</p>
          <p>As such, whilst we recommend &pound;75, you are welcome to join Raise by making a donation of a size which is significant to you and allows you to put charity at the heart of your end-of-year celebrations. It is central to our philosophy (see here for more) that students actively engage with their decision to celebrate through giving, but we recognise that the donation that enables this will not be the same for everyone.</p>
          <p>In addition, you have the option of donating in weekly installments, as some have found this more manageable. A weekly donation of &pound;5 from the donations launch up until the party adds up to about &pound;75, which will still be doubled through our matched funding.</p>
          <p>Note: We have ensured that our donations page allows you to hide your name and/or donation amount, should you choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend &pound;75?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;75 is a large amount of money, and substantially more than most students would routinely donate to charity. There are several reasons we recommend this figure:</p>
          <p><b>Encouraging considered giving:</b> We understand that donating &pound;75 is a significant commitment for any student, but this is key to our philosophy of putting giving at the heart of our celebrations. We aim to encourage students to think differently about charity, and we can only achieve this if students consciously engage in the act of giving, and donating a significant amount facilitates this. This is why we recommend &pound;75, or a donation of any size significant to the donor.</p>
          <p><b>Impact:</b> Crucially, the recommended &pound;75 amount, coupled with matched funding, allows us to have an exceptionally large impact for a student charity initiative; your &pound;75 donation, when doubled, will be enough to help protect over 170 people from malaria.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Can I donate to a different charity?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend (see below), particularly given how much money students are donating. However, we recognise that some students may want to join us in celebrating through giving, but would prefer to donate to a different charity. This is absolutely fine, but please get in touch with us beforehand so that we are aware.</p>
          <p>Note: All matched funding will still go to Against Malaria Foundation.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend donating to AMF?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At Raise, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend. When students are making such significant donations, we want to make sure the money is doing as much good as it possibly can. To make our decision, we have taken the advice of independent charity evaluators <a href='https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities'>GiveWell</a> and <a href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org'>Giving What We Can</a>, which both rank AMF as one of the most effective charities in the world.</p>
          <p>Tragically, malaria causes 400,000 preventable deaths every year, disproportionately affecting young children and pregnant women, and has a knock-on effect on the local economy. AMF works with local partners to provide life-saving bed-nets which protect people as they sleep. To find out more about their work, see <a href='https://www.againstmalaria.com/'>here</a>.</p>
          <p>Because AMF's intervention is so effective at preventing malaria, each donation can have a huge impact. For example, a donation of &pound;75, doubled through matched funding, can help protect 175 people. In fact, the money we raised nationally in 2020 was enough to protect over 120,000 people!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          What makes Raise different to a charity ball?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At Raise, we believe in putting charity at the front and centre of our celebrations. As such, we encourage students to donate because they’ve engaged positively with the impact it’s possible for their donations to have, rather than simply because there’s a party at the end of it.</p>
          <p>Crucially, the donation students make to join Raise does not constitute ‘buying a ticket’ to the party. Indeed, the funding of the Summer Party is completely separate to the donation (it’s funded through a combination of additional voluntary contributions from donors and external sponsorship). Many students have joined Raise without attending the Summer Party at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          If 100% of donations go to charity, how do you put on the Summer Party? What&#39s it like?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Summer Party is a chance for us to come together and celebrate our collective impact, as well as the end of the academic year. Crucially, 100&percnt; of the money students donate goes directly to charity – none of it is used to fund the party. As such, we invite students to make an optional contribution of &pound;10 per head, separate to their donation, to cover the costs of the event (which are generously subsidised by our sponsors). Importantly, everyone will be very welcome to join, whether or not they feel able to make this contribution.</p>
          <p>There will be music, food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and live entertainment, contributing to the atmosphere of celebration you’ll experience with the rest of the Raise community. It’s a fantastic chance to reflect on the impact of our donations and many of those who’ve attended elsewhere in recent years have described it as a real highlight!</p>

          What about COVID-19?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Naturally, we are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the ways in which we can come together over the course of this year, and we are keeping a close eye at the local and national guidance at every stage. However, even if we are not able to come together as an entire community, this will not stop us from marking the end of the year in true Raise style.  Whether in smaller groups or all together, we aim to create a meaningful and enjoyable format to bring the community together and celebrate our collective impact under these different circumstances.</p>
