          <p>Thanks to our matched funding, 200&percnt; of the money you donate goes directly to AMF. That means that
            your &pound;150 when doubled will be enough to help protect over 350 people from malaria!</p>

          <p>We&#39re so pleased you&#39re interested in MWA, and look forward to celebrating with you; here are a few ways you can help grow the movement: </p>
          <p><b>Spread the word</b>: Letting your friends know about MWA is one of the most valuable things you can do - aside
            from the huge impact of their donations, celebrating is more fun when we do it together! Why not show them
            our website, share our posts on social media, and invite friends to follow our <a
              href='https://www.facebook.com/mayweekalternative/'>Facebook</a> and <a
              href='https://www.instagram.com/mayweekalternative/'>Instagram</a> pages themselves?</p>
          <p><b>Social media</b>: One of the best ways to spread the word is through social media - you could share our
            page, or change your profile picture using our frame to show your friends that you&#39re celebrating with MWA!
          </p>
<p><b>Committee</b>: If you really want to shape the future of MWA, you could apply to join our central committee,

		  </p>
          <p><b>MWA Reps</b>: Becoming an MWA rep is a low-commitment and flexible role for people who want to spread
            the message in their college, society or social group. Applications for next academic year will open in May

          <p><b>Sponsorship</b>: In order to put on our Summer Party at the end of each year, we rely entirely on the
            support of our generous partners, including Cambridge colleges, businesses and individuals. If you
            know anyone who may be interested in supporting MWA and allowing us to grow even more, please do <a

          &pound;150 is a lot of money - what if I can't donate that?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;150 is a large amount of money for many students, and whilst we have thought
            carefully about recommending this amount (see next question), it is important to us that any student feels
            able to join us in celebrating through giving.</p>
          <p>As such, whilst we recommend &pound;150, you are welcome to join MWA by making a donation of any size which
            is <b>significant to you</b> and allows you to put charity at the heart of your May Week celebrations. It is
            central to our philosophy (see <a href='/#our-philosophy'>here</a> for more) that students actively engage
            with their decision to celebrate May Week through giving, but we recognise that the donation that enables
            this will not be the same for everyone.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have responded to student demand by adding the option of donating in weekly installments,
            as some have found this more manageable. A weekly donation of &pound;9 from the donations launch up
            until May Week adds up to &pound;150, which will still be doubled through our matched funding.</p>
          <p>Note: We have ensured that our donations page allows you to hide your name and/or donation amount, should
            you choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend &pound;150?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We recognise that &pound;150 is a large amount of money, and substantially more than most students would
            routinely donate to charity. There are several reasons we recommend this figure:</p>
            <p><b>May Week Symbolism</b>: The &pound;150 figure is representative of the cost of some May Ball tickets -
              this is symbolic of our belief that charity can be embraced as an integral part of May Week, on a par with
              May Balls.</p>
              <p><b>Encouraging considered giving</b>: We understand that donating &pound;150 is a significant commitment
                for any student, but this is key to <a href='/#our-philosophy'>our philosophy</a> of putting giving at the
                heart of May Week celebrations. We aim to encourage students to think differently about charity, and we can
                only achieve this if students consciously engage in the act of giving, and donating a significant amount
                facilitates this. This is why we recommend &pound;150, or a donation of any size significant to the donor. </p>
                <p><b>Impact</b>: Most importantly, the recommended &pound;150 amount, coupled with matched funding, allows us
                  to have an exceptionally large impact for a student charity initiative: in just two years, and from only
                  ~210 donations, we have already managed to protect over 50,000 people from malaria, more than double the
                  student population of Cambridge. We have only been able to achieve this impact because of the number of
                  students who have chosen to donate so generously.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="title">
                  <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
                  I&#39m already going to a May Ball. Is MWA really for me? (Hint: yes, definitely!)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Of course, MWA is for everyone - whether you&#39re going to three May Balls or none, we welcome you to join
            our growing community and put charity at the heart of your May Week celebrations. MWA is an alternative way
            to celebrate during May Week, but that doesn&#39t mean you can&#39t take part in other things going on!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Can I donate to a different charity?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At MWA, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend (see below), particularly given how much
            money students are donating. However, we recognise that some students may want to join us in celebrating May
            Week through giving, but would prefer to donate to a different charity. This is absolutely fine, but please
            get in touch with us beforehand so that we are aware.</p>
            <p>Note: All matched funding will still go to AMF.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="title">
          <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
          Why do you recommend donating to AMF?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At MWA, we think very carefully about which charity to recommend. When students are making such significant
            donations, we want to make sure the money is doing as much good as it possibly can. To make our decision, we
            have taken the advice of independent charity evaluators <a
            href='https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities'>GiveWell</a> and <a
            href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org'>Giving What We Can</a>, which both rank AMF as one of the most
            effective charities in the world.</p>
            <p>Tragically, malaria causes 400,000 preventable deaths every year, disproportionately affecting young
              children and pregnant women, and has a knock-on effect on the local economy. AMF works with local partners
              to provide life-saving bed-nets which protect people as they sleep. To find out more about their work, see
              <a href='https://www.againstmalaria.com/'>here</a>.</p>
              <p>Because AMF's intervention is so effective at preventing malaria, each donation can have a huge impact. For
            example, a donation of &pound;150, doubled through matched funding, can help protect 350 people. In fact,
            the money we raised in 2019 was enough to protect over 40,000 people - more than double the student
            population of Cambridge!</p>

          If 100% of donations go to charity, how do you put on the Summer Party? What&#39s it like?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Summer Party is a chance for us to celebrate our collective impact and say thank you to everyone who 
            has supported MWA throughout the year &mdash; everyone who has donated (whatever the amount) is invited. There 
            will be music, food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and live entertainment, as well as the chance to 
            enjoy the collective atmosphere of celebration at the end of the year with the rest of the MWA community and 
            reflect on the impact our donations have made. Many of those who came last year said that the feel-good 
            atmosphere was the highlight of their May Week!</p>
            <p><b>Crucially, 100% of the money students donate goes directly to charity &mdash; none of it is used to fund
              the party</b>. To make the Summer Party as enjoyable and meaningful as possible, we rely on the generous
              support, both financial and in-kind, of the university, colleges and corporate partners who buy into the MWA
            philosophy. Our venue is donated for free, performers offer their time for free, and much of the food and
            drink is either donated by local companies or paid for by sponsors. If you or anyone you know is able to
            support us through in-kind donations or sponsorship, please <a href='/#contact'>get in touch</a> or visit
            the <a href='/partner/'>Partner</a> page for more information.</p>

              We believe that charity and celebration can go hand in hand, so we invite students to make a significant
              donation as a way of celebrating May Week and the end of exams.

              Our Summer Party embodies this philosophy, as students come together during May Week to celebrate the
              collective impact of their donations.

              We hope that through MWA, students will come to think differently about giving and will take this positive
              approach towards charity forward into their future lives.
